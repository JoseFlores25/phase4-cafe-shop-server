# Cafe

## Description

This is a Coffee review application. The idea came from the experience I had with coffee.
Normally I like homemade coffee. Because my experience with outside coffee hasnâ€™t been good.
So I came up with the idea that people could post about their coffee and get a reviews for others to see.
